# Engram

A single-binary, fully local temporal memory and code knowledge graph for LLM coding
agents. Unifies three kinds of memory — code structure, project knowledge, and user
preferences — into one append-only store where facts are never mutated or deleted, only
superseded, with the reason for every revision recorded.

The success metric is **tokens the host LLM did not have to load**. Memory is a
substitute for context, not a supplement to it.

- C# / .NET 10, published as a Native AOT single-file binary
- SQLite only (WAL), one database at `~/.engram/engram.db`
- CLI for humans, MCP over stdio for agents
- No services, no containers, no runtime install

**Status:** pre-implementation. Nothing is built yet.

Start with the implementation plan — it records six decisions that resolve questions
the spec left open, and three places where the spec contradicts itself.
